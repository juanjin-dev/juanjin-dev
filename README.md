A humble system software engineer working with Linux distros, Zephyr, and IoT.
Learning by building, breaking, and documenting along the way.

## About

I am an embedded systems engineer focused on Zephyr and Linux applications, as well as IoT systems.

My main interests include Zephyr RTOS, low-level drivers, Kconfig & Devicetree, storage, bootloaders, and debugging the parts that usually fail after the tutorial ends.

I approach this craft as a *工人* - a practitioner who learns through implementation, failure, and revision.

## Philosophy

- Prefer understanding over convenience
- Trust source code over assumptions
- Expect failures at system boundaries, not APIs

My views may be incomplete, and my implementations imperfect, but everything here is grounded in real work and real failures.
